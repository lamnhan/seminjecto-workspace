# Seminjecto Workspace Skeleton

Skeleton for a [Seminjecto](https://github.com/lamnhan/seminjecto) Google Workspace add-on.

## How to use?

Clone this repo or use the [Seminjecto](https://github.com/lamnhan/seminjecto) `new` command.

See [Seminjecto](https://github.com/lamnhan/seminjecto) for more detail.

## Notes

It is intended to use this skeleton for building Google Workspace Add-ons in the future, but for now you can only use this to build [Editor add-ons](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/concepts/types#editor_add-ons). We will update the skeleton to support the new generation of [Gogle Workspace add-on](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/concepts/types#add-ons) soon.
